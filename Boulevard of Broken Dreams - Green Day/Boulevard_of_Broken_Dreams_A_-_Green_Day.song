verse:
    [a:m]   I walk a [c]lonely road
    The [g]only one that [d]I have ever [a:m]known
    Don't know [c]where it goes
    [g]But it's home to [d]me and I walk [a:m]alone

verse:
    I walk this empty street
    On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
    Where the city sleeps
    And I'm the only one and I walk alone

pre-chorus:
    [a:m c] [g]I walk a[d]lone, I walk alone
    [a:m c] [g]I walk a[d]lone, I walk a...

chorus:
    [f]   My [c]shadow's the [g]only one that [a:m]walks beside me
    [f]   My [c]shallow [g]heart's the only [a:m]thing that's beating
    [f]   Some[c]times I [g]wish someone out [a:m]there will find me
    [f]   'Til [c]then I [e]walk alone

verse:
    Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, aaah-ah,
    Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

verse:
    I'm walking down the line
    That divides me somewhere in my mind
    On the border line
    Of the edge and where I walk alone

verse:
    Read between the lines
    Of what's messed up and everything's alright
    Check my vital signs
    To know I'm still alive and I walk alone
