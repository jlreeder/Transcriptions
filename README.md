# Transcriptions
A collection of musical transcriptions I have created

The transcriptions here are all made freely available; please attribute
them in all use, and if you make your own derivative work, give that away
freely too! (Specifically, CC-BY-SA. And don't forget to attribute the works
to all authors, not just me.)
